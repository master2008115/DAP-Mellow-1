“DAP Mellow”
Diagnostic Area Product

As we know there are thousands of people who suffer from coma. Some are recovered soon and very few long – term data is available on people who survive coma. But research conducted in the year 2015 states that Coma patients recover faster when they hear a familiar voice. Seeing a loved one in a bedridden condition is a devastating moment for family members. Many feel they are powerless to the situation and have no way of helping out. It could be, however, that the sound of a familiar voice is the best tool for coma recovery.
Considering this issue, our team came up with a device to help with it.
This application is known as “DAP Mellow”. “DAP Mellow” stands for Diagnostic Area and Product.
This application would not only be helpful for coma patients but is also helpful for some other people suffering from dangerous diseases like:
•	Contracture (shrinkage of muscles and reduction in movement)
•	Osteoporosis (Bone decay)
•	Hypotension (Hyper tension)
•	Decreased Cardiac Output (the rate of blood pumped by the blood is decreased)
•	Depression
We not only target patients but also focus on people who suffer from extreme loneliness and depression.

About the device:
This application has 2 modes:
1.	ONE SIDED CONVERSATION
2.	INTERACTIVE MODE (Optional)

ONE SIDED CONVERSATION MODE
This mode is specifically for people those who are bed ridden due to above mentioned diseases and those whose health restricts them from speaking. Especially those who are in vegetative state and minimally conscious state of coma. The main motive of this device would be:
•	To help coma patients recover by making the atmosphere around them lively.
•	It would help coma patients recover faster than normal treatment.

INTERACTIVE MODE
This mode is for the people who are depressed, especially the adolescent age.
This device would:
•	Make them laugh giving creative and fun replies to their questions.
•	Motivate them when they feel low.
•	It would reduce their screen-time.

Cost-
We don’t have many expenses as we are writing the code by ourselves. It would cost no more than ₹1500.
